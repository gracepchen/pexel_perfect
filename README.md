### Grace Chen, 6/21/18

Created as a small personal project to practice web scraping and to explore some useful Java libraries.

### Running the programe
`java GeneratePexel.java <filename>`

### Purpose 
Strips out more common words from the given text file, generates a stock image from Pexels for 0-20% of the most important words, and downloads the stock image (with .jpg extension) to the user's computer under /pexel_imgs. Takes about 3 minutes to process 1k words.
